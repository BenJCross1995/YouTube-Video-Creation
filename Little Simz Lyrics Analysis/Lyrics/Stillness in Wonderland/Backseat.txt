[Hook]
Oh
All my life been a black sheep
All my life been the black keys
True I never really was a bad breed
Daddy probably rather me an athlete
Man that nigga move like a taxi
All my life in the backseat
You talk about life is it that sweet?
All these eyes staring at me

[Verse 1]
I've been feeling real low nigga, lowkey (lowkey)
How a brave heart feeling so weak? (so weak)
Tattoos on my passport, no sleep (no sleep)
This is what you asked for don't weep
Don't winge, man I'm here and I won't leave
All I wanna do, make songs, blow trees
Wouldn't be honest with myself if I don't speak
So I make the point to address 'em man you know me (hey)
Got me believing in Buddha the more I proceed (yuh)
Oh this life isn't guaranteed (yuh)
All my life felt a cold breeze
In and out but staying up and never down, you hearing me now?
Give me some time and a little space, I'll figure it out
They wanna know my whereabouts, and who I'm around
Been in wonderland for time, tryna' find our way out
You can hear it my rhymes, I'll be thinking aloud
I'ma be ghost for a minute don't get in your feelings
I ain't even wrote for a minute, not a single lyric
Man I got a life that is crazy most cannot live it
See 'em tryna' sabotage me, got me fucking livid

[Hook]
All my life been a black sheep
All my life been the black keys
True I never really was a bad breed
Daddy probably rather me an athlete
Man that nigga move like a taxi (yuh)
All my life in the backseat (yuh)
Talk about life is it that sweet? (yuh)
All these eyes staring at me (yuh)

[Post-Hook]
Phone rings and I missed called everyone
All I hear 'em saying is look what you've become
This is what you signed up, before you forget
This is what you get, uh, this is what you get

[Verse 2]
All these eyes in the front row, hella' pure souls in the front row
Remember seeing J Cole I was in the front row
Couldn't move, was in awe if you must know
Still struggling to find who I trust though
All my life in the cut though (yuh)
All my life caught the bus home, through the north side
Then I got a pedal bike, mommy flipped when I got home
Like, people get, killed out here but mummy I'm a rider and a fighter
Never been a dickhead in life, don't ever try me
Don't get it confused 'cause I'm humble and I'm quiet
Loud niggas step into Simz and get silenced
I ain't gotta say how but it don't involve violence
Though I got Gs that are already in the hair for it
But there's no need, I just want peace
Take me higher, get an eight from the supplier
Make your mind up, what you mean? What you desire?
Niggas hating but it's cool man, it's a minor
I just do me on my own and I'm the driver
Twenty-three feeling older and I'm wiser
All my life been searched for what I'd die for
Guess I am the one, the people I'ma fight for
Surely you should know who you rep, who you ride for

[Hook]
All my life been a black sheep
All my life been the black keys
True I never really was a bad breed (bad breed)
Daddy probably rather me an athlete
Man that nigga move like a taxi (yuh)
All my life in the backseat (yuh)
Talk about life is it that sweet? (yuh)
All these eyes staring at me (yuh)

This is what you get, this is what you get
