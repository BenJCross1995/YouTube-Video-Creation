[Little Simz]
Feet up, on the dashboard
Nigga knock knock, it's your landlord
Enter the function through the back door
All eyes on me I got the damn sauce
They say "'llow the guitar, you should rap more,"
I can do both, cause I'm that raw
Fuck the damn law, no rules here
Imma stand for, what I rap for
We should probably go back to the trade days
Why does anybody need so much cash for?
Must be a hypocrite because when the money ain't right
I be telling them to raise the stack more
Who's to blame that I think that way
But being broke
I could never swing that way
Never again, due to the power of the pen
I'm blessed
Running around on my A game shit, I'm next, oh
Figured imma do my best, oh
Giving you all that's left of me
I could make do with less, oh
Cruising through the west, oh
Banging that Tribe Called Quest, oh
I don't need too much in life
Just give me my respect
Know that Simz has depth, oh
Shit I ain't even got to say no more
Don't have to explain no more
True, I been changing the game for sure
Ain't got to worry bout keys no more
Shit man I'm not 18 no more
Well time is a concept
Still enough of that shit
We ain't got left
Got left though

[SiR]
I can't tell the future anymore
But it's just a phase
Just a phase
It's just a phase
Just a phase
Oh, thought I'd always be the same person
But it's just a phase
Just a phase
It's just a phase
Just a phase

[Little Simz]
Faces, many faces
Know that I can deal with what I'm faced with
Thought that I would never lose that one braid
Guess I was going through phases
Yes I been going through changes
Learning to do shit in stages
Got me in all different stages
Took the leap I'm courageous
Wonderland was deserted
Then I found my oasis
Had to unlearn the bullshit
Take it way back to basics
Saw the white rabbit and followed it down
Into something amazing
What on earth am I witnessing
What a mindfuck I tell ya
See I put the great in greatness
I put the a, in normal
Add the ab, when I rap shit, be sounding abnormal
I didn't come to be formal
I just came to rap for you
You should walk through that portal, with me
This might just be eternal
Lowkey I'm immortal
Don't doubt me, that's awful
Never here to be forceful
Anybody can believe in what they want
As long as that shit works for you
Brought it, you see me?
I respect that shit
Got dreams, you better protect that shit
Got dreams, you better protect that shit
Got reason had to progress in this

[SiR]
Oh, I can't tell the future anymore
But it's just a phase
It's just a phase
It's just a phase
Just a phase
Oh, thought I'd always be the same person
But it's just a phase
Just a phase
It's just a phase
Just a phase

[Little Simz]

[SiR]
I barely call my mama on the phone
But it's just a phase
Just a phase
It's just a phase
Just a phase
Just a phase
Oh, thought I'd always be the same person
But it's just a phase
Just a phase
It's just a phase
Just a phase
Well whatever I'm doing shit it's working
It's working
This is working, working
