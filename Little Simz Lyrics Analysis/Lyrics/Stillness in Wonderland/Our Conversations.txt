Conversations with Mother Earth
Father he left with no warning I'm so disturbed
Shit that you're feeding me man I'm sure that I've stomached worse
Trying to open my eyes knowing my vision's blurred
Everything so absurd, know I'm an introvert
So I know the feeling when you seen but you never heard
It's crazy ain't it, looking to the heavens like "can you save me, maybe?"
Am I a little too ambitious, but my origin is not this planet
The apocalypse will soon commence
How do you feel when your soul's abandoned
My appearance is turning morbid
No secrets inside the stories
The apocalypse will soon commence
What would you do is a forfeit
Shit man my thoughts are distorted
I'm in too deep
Though it's not all dark look at the scenery
Trees grow into the sky look at the leaves beneath
Yellow and orange are the colors that will speak to me
Synesthesia ain't deceiving me
Mind right flow tight and my heart is where it needs to be
As long as the people believe in me
Look into my eyes shit man I can tell that you're reading me
As long as the people believe in me
I don't mind

If I wait for you, if I wait for you
Don't say it to me
Don't waste all your time on me, your time, your time
I'll be patient, said I'll be patient
I'm patient with you so please can you bear with me
Can you bear with me 'cause I made the life I chose
I can't be waiting
I'll be waiting
I said I'll be waiting
So can you bear with me?
'Cause we made the life we chose

Conversations with space
And it's station for noon until it's late
No one else can relate to all the bass
Chilling out with the gang lad
Smurs is probably on the keys
Till he's probably rolling weed
Joshua's probably choosing me
Tosh has dropped his new release
This is what we chose to do
And this is who we chose to be
All so damn experimental know the signs influence me
Working on improving me
Know I'm not the perfect being
Boy see I'm just being honest
Don't waste time pursuing me
Shit I got a crew with me
Know just it's due to be
We're just young and living life
Like there's no tomorrow
We're just young and living life
Like there's no tomorrow
Once it's mine, it's mine
I take it, keep it, shit is never borrowed
I be on this I don't know the way
You should've never followed my apologies
And promise me eulogy
Whole is mine arts
Pearly gates said he far from here
My life has ended, gimme one thing I should start to fear
I said don't be weak, don't be a slave to the world that feet
Rise up on your feet, there's a whole world that is yours for keeps
He says you have no idea do you, no idea do you?
When you see so many people and know no one's here for you
Don't you question me, you don't know what I've been through
What I've gained is nothing compared to what I did

If I wait for you, if I wait for you
Don't say it to me
Don't waste all your time on me, your time, your time
I'll be patient, said I'll be patient
I'm patient with you so please can you bear with me
Can you bear with me â€˜cause I made the life I chose
I can't be waiting
I'll be waiting
I said I'll be waiting
So can you bear with me?
'Cause we made the life we chose
