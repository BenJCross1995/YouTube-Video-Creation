Sunset touch down in Dubai
Where the ganja's hella dank and the air is hella dry
Remy blowing
My shit flowing
Thought I told ya
Million dollar pen don't make me show ya

[Bibi Bourelly]
Yeah, curtains automatic amsterdam
Got a couple hood niggas couple gentlemen
Save your ass from out the hood fly your ass out to japan
Bye to KFC have some pad thai in thailand
Motorbikes on paris streets
Boy you know that I'm the man-dem hollering at me
What you saying out in London
Airport security tryna fuck with me in customz
Come fuck with me in customz
'least my team in customz
'least my team in
'least my team in

Attention
Ladies and gentlemen
Flight 481 from San Francisco has been delayed due to ... maintenance malfunction

[Little Simz]
Oooo I got my passport stamp man I'm good
You ain't been living enjoying life the way you should
Want you to understand me shit i been so misunderstood
This liquor comes in handy
Have that sprite mixed with some brandy on a beach somewhere I'm good
One way ticket to where its at
Out in new zealand shit i don't know when i'll be back
Tryna get you to come fuck with me
Theres way more than just your city
Put your finger on the map
Choose a place
We'll book it now just say the word
Getting money on a low low how it all goes
Treating all these niggas here like they been hoes
You should fly out come and see it first hand cos' there's no way you can get the gist from the photos
I ain't playing wit ya
No time for the games wit' ya
Speak up what you saying nigga
See they want us to be small but we stay bigger
Ain't no hiding away from the sun when the rays hit ya
Don't worry about the images that they picture
Your people are good here if they came wit ya
New lifestyle its a new life good things come to you if you do right
I put your arse on a flight to my city its my city
Ain't gotta ask you twice to ride with me
I land they grab my bags
Driver tell me what's the plan

[Bibi Bourelly]
I got my passport stamp boy relax
Charge you for a feature.. fuck your track
You can't afford it
We be touring
You ain't important
Baggy in a make-up bag my best bitch got deported
100 degree in babylon
Hair laid bronx shit
Dominican know you know this
My shit flowing
Remy blowing
Ride to LAX gotta get to heathrow in the morning

[Little Simz]
Oooo stamp of approval more than you know
This is more than approving more than you show
Everything you hear is crucial why would i lie
I can be the one to show you the time of your life
When the timing is right
Don't fight that shit
Look me in my eyes know you like that shit
Hella bud here better light that shit
Ignite that shit
Chillin man I'm easy
Fix up look sharp when you see me
No telling where this path might lead me
I've never needed a man to complete me

But oh curtains automatic Mexico
Bet you this some shit that you ain't never seen before
Take you out of the dungeon fly your arse to Puerto Rico
You just gotta say the word you just let me know

[Bibi Bourelly]
