[Verse 1]
The pinnacle of what we can get to
Is the thing that's gonna test you
Make your best move
Call who to the rescue
You can save yourself
God bless you
Imma always be a strong woman in my heart
I'm the type to pull it together not apart
Ready to keep it pushing when the engine starts
Lane switch every other day in a car got me chasing
Now I got a dream in the stars
You can never be basic
How d'ya beat the challenges that you're faced with
Who I came with
Space age spaced out in the space station
Ain't nothing changed
Now they want a piece of the pie
Shoulda listened when I came in the game
This ain't none of the weak shit
Damn, all you rappers sayin, sounding the same
Better gimme that

[Chorus]
When your time is up
And you're feeling low
And you drink too much
Then the cycle goes on

Do you even wanna be here
Don't pretend that you can't see
I don't even wanna be here
Hope that you remember me

[Verse 2]
We love harder in the struggle
But gotta make it out, gotta make it out
Before this shit lands me in trouble
Why we living in a bubble
Women are trying to get the diamond ring from a man
There's a bigger plan
So figure it out while you can
Bowin' my head and prayin' they understand
Given every last bit of my being to the fans
Boy I went through, steady grew into the man
And I've grown up
Know now, I'm a legacy
Oh boy would you learn from me
When you meet the one don't treat her any worse that me
I'm not perfect no, I've made mistakes
But don't lie to my face
Though the truth hurts, I'll be okay
Be ruthless, that ain't no way
Yo give me that, give me that

[Chorus]
Say when your time is up
And you're feeling low
Then you drink too much
Then the cycle goes on
Do you even wanna be here
Don't pretend that you can't see
I don't ever wanna be here
Hope that you remember me

[Hook]
Tide's low
And the mind's blowin'
Tryna find the right way on this ride home
Shit I might know it
But who decides though
Shoulda known that this more than suicidal

Tide's low
And the mind's blowing
Tryna find the right way on this ride home
Shit I might know it
But who decides though
Shoulda known that this more than suicidal

[Chorus]
Say when your time is up
And you're feeling low
And you drink too much
Then the cycle goes on

Do you even wanna be here
Don't pretend that you can't see
No I don't even wanna be here
Well I hope that you remember me-e

[Hook]
Tide's low
And the mind's blowing
Tryna find the right way on this ride home
Shit I might know it
But who decides though
Shoulda known that this more than suicidal
