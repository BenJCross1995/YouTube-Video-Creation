[Part I: Doorways]

[Intro]
Aye, looking through this hallway
In a different place from what I know, a different ballgame
What is through the doorway
Keep it pushing always
Seeing different from what I’ve been told, been thinking all day
Ohhh, this is so smooth coming from you know who
Anybody can say anything I’d rather show you
Ohhh, I’mma be free now
Give you what you need
This is how it’s supposed to be

[Verse 1]
This is how it’s supposed to be
When it’s 30 plus degrees
Riding with the windows down
Oooo just so you can see me in it
I don’t mean to brag, it’s the shit I never had
Haters are forever mad, I just laugh, then hit the dab
Oh keep on doing what I do, am I a good girl gone bad?
Shit, I’ll try not to be flash, true I’ll say it ‘cause I can
Woah, hold up Simbi what has gotten into you these days?
When was it about the stuntin’, when was it about your pay?
Www…wait please slow down, I’m a pro now
My last name means count money, can you pronounce it?
Ajikawo, heir to the throne now
I don’t belong anywhere, not even my own town
Am I insecure now, speaking on my thoughts now
Shit, I know I got trust issues, it’s hard to ignore now
What have I become, am I losing all control now?
Think I better go now

[Spoken Interlude]
What happened when I followed the white rabbit?
I’ll never be perfect to me
I’ll never stop questioning what more I can to do to love myself
Not knowing how to do that only results in trust issues
I may seem perfect to you but I come with layers
And this is more than one

[Part II: Trust Issues]

[Hook]
Trust issues, trust issues
You know what I’m sippin’
I'll teach you how to mix it, you’re the only one
I don’t trust these bitches
I don’t trust these niggas
I don’t trust anyone apart from who I came with
Is that bad of me?
Don’t be mad at me
Know my imperfections make me who I plan to be
Though what's slowing me down is trust issues

[Verse 2]
Oh, everybody’s got some sort of faith inside them
Gotta find where it lives
More time I’m alone when I pray in silence
God knows how I think
Everybody’s got some sort of faith inside ‘em
No such thing as hate inside ‘em
You search more then you was findin’ and take what life gives
To you on a daily basis, all I see is faces
Medical rolled
A little conversation is all I need
I’ve been seeing different places
It’s hard to leave, we are the key
When you’re in a bubble you know it’s hard to see
In and out of trouble can’t see past the now
Trapped inside my mind, lost can’t be found
I’ll get us in, if you buy the rounds
City's on a hold whenever I’m in town
It’s going up, Space Age, man you know it’s us
Everybody’s gonna talk instead of showing love
They take something real small then they blow it up
Can’t take the fake shit these days
Everybody want to fake shit these days
While you’re being wasteful in a time of need
I be out here trying to save shit these days
Never take to the ‘he says, she says’
Gotta get it from the main source these days
Nobody is an angel these days
You disagree better speak up please say
Everybody’s got a life here, and free will
I’m the type to lay low and be still
Type to make a nigga open up and say how he feels
You bet he won’t but I bet he will

[Hook]
Everybody’s got trust issues
You know what I’m sippin’
I'll teach you how to mix it
You’re the only one
I don’t trust these bitches
I don’t trust these niggas
I don’t trust anyone apart from who I came with
Is that bad of me?
Don’t be mad
My imperfections make me who I plan to be
Though what's slowing me down is trust issues
