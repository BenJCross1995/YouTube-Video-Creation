[Interlude]
Her
You will love what I find in you
If you're real they won't hide the truth
I've been told that before
We the core of the world
I'm not an ordinary girl
That was never my fate
Is the heaven my place?
I'm forever in space
Got some shit I need changing
I'll confess to your face
Would you miss me if I
Up and left you today?
Ain't no games to be played
No, I am not insane
My heart's in agony now
If you believe love is pain
Still, I'll never complain
I miss the bond like a motherless child
Heart rates been going for miles
Cherish the roots of the world
Can you survive in the wild?
Fronting and faking a smile
Venting to the world of Twitter
How they be teefing your style
Crazy you know
I'm just freeing my soul
I'm content but all I ask is hold me down or let me go
You see, it's crazy, you know
I'm just freeing my soul
I'm content but all I ask is hold me down or let me go
Let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go
