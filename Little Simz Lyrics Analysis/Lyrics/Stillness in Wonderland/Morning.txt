Lately i've been hearing all these cold stories
I can't even blink anymore
Wouldn't be me if I didn't record it
You should already know if you know me

Now i can't sleep no no no
I just wanna see morning
Shit be feeling dark here and lonely
Am I getting back to the old me
Feels like I can't think anymore
More than ever thoughts are distorted

Can't lie I been under it for real real
But pressure makes diamonds we know this

Hopin' love is round the corner for me
Don't wanna be single forever with no kids
What is even that important to me?
If it's not the life that we live

Living life in the backseat
Need me some herb to relax me
Fuck what you thought this is mad deep
I need your support in this man please
Came through the door with no plan b
Don't feel secure in this new age
But if i fall will you catch me?
Must look beyond what you can see

Are you seeing this as a come up?
I must be the realest maybe another
In my thoughts and feelings for many days
I just want you to be proud of me mama
No one gave me money no not a favor
Little simbi made it what none the less
Fuck i give about me becoming famous
I swore that I would be the greatest

Hopin' love is round the corner for me
Don't wanna be single forever with no kids
What is even that important to me?
If it's not the life that we live
OOO-OOO-OOO
If it's not the life that we live
OOO-OOO-OOO
If it's not the life that we live

Lately i've been hearing more and more stories
Man that shit pains my soul
Know i'm in wonderland but i'm still stuck here
I don't want to be here anymore

Now my heart bleeds wide open
Does anybody hear my call?
Shit be feelin dark here and lonely
Am i getting back to the old me?

Hopin' love is round the corner for me
Don't wanna be single forever with no kids
What is even that important to me?
If it's not the life that we live
