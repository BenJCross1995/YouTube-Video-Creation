[Hook: Little Simz & Tilla]
Three zones, anywhere I go
So amazed, I'm there nowhere to me
Canary Islands, then Morocco
Down to Asia and the Philippines

[Verse 1: Little Simz]
Take time, how's your rhyme following the bassline
Came through with this space, I ain't gotta say it
Even though I know you heard it through the grapevine
Be cool
I'm chill, never been the type to get hyped and make fight
Energy is not for that and I advise
You put it towards what you love doing in life
They pick up my flaws and commend me when I write
I challenge myself at all costs and all times
They give you some fake shit, lies and poor rhymes
Shit blows my mind
Living in a dark place in the dark ages
I can see what's on the other side, I can't wait
'till we're all on the other side, I'll say
There's gonna be a revolution, better partake
What will be the resolution here in our case?
Tell me, never could I let the system fail me
Never could I let them distance sell me
Mother didn't grow me up to be a dick
Selfless to the poor what I have I'll give, ain't nuttin'
Them a get shutdown like it ain't nuttin'
Anybody got an issue, you can say suttin'
Take nuttin' and we'll make suttin', that's how it goes

[Hook: Little Simz & Tilla]
Three zones, anywhere I go
So amazed, I'm there nowhere to me
Canary Islands, then Morocco
Down to Asia and the Philippines

More to the world than we're seeing
This must be more than a dream
I could get used to the fast life, I'm coming home
This time I'm all on my own

[Verse 2: Josh Arce]
Be easy, heads up when the funds go down
Nobody will try give you a heads-up
When shit goes south in this North pole breezy
But it's oh so sweet
When you get from the cane to the tea and the tree to the paper
I make what I see, and what I see isn't always in front of me
Mmm perceptive, came through with the crew I left with
Left here with the same I came with
Only difference is my new perspective
So psychic, if unlikely things happen then I likely guessed it
No time for no tries for ideas
I try more at least I can test 'em
I feel pressure for no reason, probably all this greatness resting
On my shoulders and the ache I've dealt with
All coming from the brain I'm messed with
Insane from the same thing that keeps me sane
But the sky gives both the sunlight and rain
Never knew how blue you could feel when
It's grey, but the light will always find a way

[Verse 3: Chuck20]
It's violent, living and I wanna take I-
Space I don't wanna take flight
Of course only menna be living in great heights
Uh, shit's changed, I'm looking through the life in this lense
If I cross the line my life's gone tonight
God sighted, it all depends
On my thoughts, I'm cautious, 'course I'm cautious
I don't wanna fall in all this, I don't wanna be in danger
Tryna find my life and saviour
Tell me where the light time forces
I just wanna write my fortune, callin'
I don't wanna keep on fallin'
I don't wanna keep ignoring people
I just wanna keep on walking, I'm walking
Been restrained from collecting gold
Controlling this way of living restraining, still essence flows
Well fool me, shit's like a movie directing my only role
The true me's the only me debt is truly in my three zone, go

[Hook: Little Simz & Tilla]
More to the world than we're seeing

I could get used to the fast life, I'm coming home
This time I'm all on my own
