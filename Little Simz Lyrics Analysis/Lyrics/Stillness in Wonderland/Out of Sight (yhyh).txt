[Verse 1]
Uh, ride slow
In the world I chose
Trip to space with my folks, I just might ho'
In and out, time's up, you say that you want this life
I can be a life coach, no problem, follow me
Burn on tree, high so, high I might, die ho
Come back to life, I rose from beneath
Growth is key, maybe mine slow, don't take my advice though
Shit man what do I know? He love when I speak about it
Got, niggas, mind-blown, in the nick of time, oh my oh
Never lost in my brain, I can never let you inside ho
Shit, time up, back to wonderland, I go
Searching for roots, but be dying trying find home

[Hook]
Came up, tryin' to stay up
They ask if the land of wondering has changed us
Tell 'em yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah
How it's possible to stay the same
Out of sight, can you see me on the current frame?
Tell 'em yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah

[Verse 2]
If I'm wrong, speak up, niggas talking weak stuff
They can bite my sweet dust, it's that time to keep up
I've always tried to score, now just aiming at your keeper
Shit's been getting realer, had convos with the reaper
Once the soul of a teacher, watch your tone when you speaking
Will you earn my complete trust, will you learn
Bridges burning and tables turnt
Children dying, mother's yearned
Preachers lying non-stop, do you even care or are you unconcerned?
What is life? I've been tryna exercise the muscles in my brain
Look at my mistakes, handle lies and rectify
Slow is always left behind
Slow is always taking time
Slow is always dotting i's and crossing t's on my beliefs (on my beliefs..)

[Hook]
Came up, tryin' to stay up
They ask if the land of wondering has changed us
Tell 'em yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah
How it's possible to stay the same
Out of sight, can you see me on the current frame?
Tell 'em yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah

[Verse 3]
Out of sight, out of mind, out of time, out of love
Out of breath, out of body, out of weed, out my nut
What to rush, who you with? such and such
Feel me much? Feel me now? Hold me down, keep me grounded if you must
In the midst, of it all, out the north of that LDN
I was born in the land of sin, my core cannot handle this
I'm more than your average chick, fuck what to rush
Out of love, out of funds, out of body, souls and such

[Bridge]
Oh, well you know I'm on the road, yeah yeah
Got me right here on my own, yeah yeah
They gon' see no further than they nose, yeah yeah
I'm just in my zone, yeah yeah

[Hook]
Came up, tryin' to stay up
They ask if the land of wondering has changed us
Tell 'em yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah
