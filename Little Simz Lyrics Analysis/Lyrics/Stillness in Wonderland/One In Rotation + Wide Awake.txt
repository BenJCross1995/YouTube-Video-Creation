[Part I: One in Rotation]

[Refrain: Little Simz]
Know you’re gonna feel
You don’t know the half you better chill
Worked my arse off without a meal
I don’t need no sympathy, promise they will remember me
That’s my word to keep, you might learn from me
This ain’t hard to read, I’m just asking please
To be heard now

[Verse 1: SiR]
I don’t want to be an overnight sensation
I’m tryin’ to make a record you can’t stop playin’
I’m tryin’ to make a record you can’t stop sayin’
I’m tryin’ to make a record you can’t forget
I’m the shit, I’m just waiting ‘till we’re all in agreement
I’m just trying to be the one you believe in
I’m just trying to be the one in rotation
Tell them play me on your radio station
I don’t want to be no one hit wonder
I’m trying to find some new skin to crawl under
I’m trying to find a new beat to go ape shit
Trying to parade this way that I’m made with
I’m not trying to be the fly by night time
Ain’t really made for the limelight, but I wanna live life
‘Till I’m living life under bright lights
Spit it till you hit that, I’m already in my prime

[Hook: SiR]
I’m trying to be that nigga
Do a few shows, let my name get bigger
Do a few mo’, let my bank account fill up
Tell you how I feel till you finally feel us
I’m trying to be that nigga
Do a few shows, let my name get bigger
Do a few mo’, let my bank account fill up
Tell you how I feel till you finally feel us

[Verse 2: Little Simz]
It’s like sound of my fears
Get on with your shit and handle your business
12 months never looked so manic in my life
I’ma take the title as the man of the year this year
It’s familiar, I’ve been here
Been disheartened, still my heart stay sincere
Things are never really like what they seem
Life got to me when I hit that eighteen
Trying to get them to recognise, heard but ain’t seen
Niggas biting flows, but they still ain’t me
This, that, let it slide, I’ma be alright
Never losing sight, kid is doing fine, shit is do or die
Don’t be quick to judge me
Life is hard, but it’s lovely
On a mad one, I must be
No one can say that they bus me
Did it on my own terms

[Hook: SiR]
I’m trying to be that nigga
Do a few shows, let my name get bigger
Do a few mo’, let my bank account fill up
Tell you how I feel till you finally feel us
I’m trying to be that nigga
Do a few shows, let my name get bigger
Do a few mo’, let my bank account fill up
Tell you how I feel till you finally feel us

[Refrain: Little Simz]
Know you’re gonna feel
You don’t know the half you better chill
Worked my arse off without a meal
I don’t need no sympathy, promise they will remember me
That’s my word to keep, you might learn from me
This ain’t hard to read, I’m just asking please
To be heard now

[Part II: Wide Awake]

[Verse: Little Simz]
Don’t be so hard on your
Self, you a star in this
We play a part in this
Look where we are in this
Came from the soil and grew
Up to be loyal, count my
Blessings, what's worth more here?
Money or oil?
This is that DMT
This is that DMT
Don't you stay there asleep
Better wake up and smell the coffee
Whats meant to will be
What is, meant to will be
I stay wide awake, wide awake
Wide awake, wide awake
