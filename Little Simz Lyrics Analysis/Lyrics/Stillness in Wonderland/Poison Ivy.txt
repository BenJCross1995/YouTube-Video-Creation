[Verse 1: Little Simz]
This is toxic I know
We ain't doing ourselves any good
We ain't doing ourselves any favours
We'll forever be I wish we could
I'll forever be misunderstood
This is toxic I know
Cut it off from now, man I should
Tell you that I'm out, man I should
Got me so attached and I hate it
Something on your chest, you should say it
Don't you know there's rules to the game
Better learn the game 'fore you play it

[Pre-Hook: Little Simz]
This is toxic I know
But I'm on the edge, don't push me now
Don't let me down

[Hook: Tilla]
You're bad for me
Poison Ivy
All I ask is from you
Show me love, show me now
Show me love, show me now
Show me love, show me now
Show me love, show me now
But you, let me go, let me down

[Verse 2:Little Simz]
Maybe this is all in my in my head
Now I got your thoughts in my head
Tryna' give you mine though instead
Don't be so indecisive oh he said
Go with the flow and vibe is what he said
Be gentle with my heart is yeah I say
Then we fuss and fight oh we bled
Don't be so insecure, oh he says
I'll be yours for sure, oh he says
Make me a better person I will say
In your eyes all I see is red

[Pre-Hook: Little Simz]
This is toxic I know
But I'm on the edge, don't push me now
But don't let me down

[Hook: Tilla]
You're bad for me
Poison Ivy
All I ask is from you
Show me love, show me now
Show me love, show me now
Show me love, show me now
Show me love, show me now
Won't you

[Verse 3: Little Simz]
Got me up and down and you know it's long
I can always tell when there's something wrong
Ain't no telling what dimension you are from
We will never know if you and I belong
Got me hella weak, I can barely speak
I need a release, can I hit the bong
Ain't no telling what dimension you are from
We will never know if you and I belong

[Hook: Tilla]
Show me love, show me now
Show me love, show me now
Show me love, show me now
Show me love, show me now
But you, let me go, let me down
