[Intro]
Finally I'm getting paid off this shit
Spent years, spent months, spent days on this shit
(What does that even mean?)
Look at me, once again I was made for this shit
Look at me, once again I was made for this

[Verse 1]
Yo, quit hit let the thing blow
Never miss shit here
This been a bad girl since year six
Springing out and in my fist
If I decide to make you a target, pissed
Been a lone wolf most of my life
Cut niggas off one time
Never looked back since
Couldn't have been
Aiming your rhymes at me
I'm immune to it
Oh, must've missed that diss
Whose gonna get this work?
Who holds number one spot on my hit list?
I don't wanna shame nobody
But the time has come all my bros and sist
Red motherfucker, when I bring it here
No you wouldn't dare motherfucker
I got niggas that could make you disappear motherfucker
When it comes down to it you a scared little sucker
Let him go
Wasting big people time like
Say I've got big heaps of time on my hands
No nigga I don't
If you know Ajikawo
I may think twice of sparing you
But they won't
Family and pack of lions
You rappers are liars and frauds
I've got a bullet of honesty aiming it right at your jaw

[Bridge]
Come see this master at work
Come see young Simbi on tour
(Come see me, come see me)
You'll see young Simbi in Highbury
You'll see young Simbi in stores
(Come see me, come see me)
Look at young Simbi in Vogue
Look at young Simbi in Forbes
(Cool magazine pose)
Well someone's gotta do it right
Someone's gotta open doors

[Verse 2]
Cause this is bigger than you thought
Thought I was finished, let me give you more
I'm a creator, dripping down in sauce
Dripping down in honesty
Dripping down in my mother's love
I'm dripping down in velour
It's public knowledge that I'm an unstoppable force
Been already won the battle
Now come in and I Lil Dicky
Do you fuck with the war?
But you know I had a bad boy pin
About listening like
Bro I can't lie, she sick
Acting clueless, you already know
Any time I pen something I never miss
If you're gonna step this way
Better come with your friend Mach-10
But you are not a bad boy now
You was never a bad boy then
(Come see me, come see me)
Niggas that I know don't talk much
Come from a loud boy ends
Why do you feel to pretend?
It's like you're dying to play this character living this life that's based on real life events
What an event
What are fucking ginnels
Dying to see what is next, yeah
Wave level is way up right now
I'm a burning holy grail
They been overlooking the work, great
But hold on not you as you as well
Do what you gotta do
As you when they try do me
When it all fails (fails)
Tryna keep tabs on me
Monitoring my moves
I'm not your girlfriend

[Outro]
Finally I'm getting paid off this shit
Spent years, spent months, spent days on this shit
(What does that even mean?)
Look at me, once again I was made for this shit
Look at me, once again I was made for this
