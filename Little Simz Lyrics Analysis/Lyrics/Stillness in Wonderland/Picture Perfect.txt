[Intro]
Welcome to Wonderland, Simbi
Trust in your intuition

[Refrain]
What a wizard I am, bitch, I'm the man
Don't be scared, give me your hand, take you to Wonderland
Man, this really ain't in the plan, but fuck all your plans, let's go
(Come here)

[Verse 1]
Wolves howl at any hour cross 'em
And they'll devour you in a second
Better mind how you walk through
Making it out alive is something I hope to
On my life, there's wonder and terror and beauty and danger
Independent here on my own, still doing it major
Here you cannot be on the phone, so do me a favour
W-w-wait, slow down, rabbit holes where it goes down
Do not interrupt the flow now, look at me
Eyes peeled, know you're gonna be healed
I've been down in nitty-gritty and stayed in the hills
I've been all over the world now, but never to chill
Been exposed to finer things and Italian meals
What a change

[Hook]
Wonderland is amazing, ain't it? (Ain't it?)
Been partying for days on the same shit (Same shit)
Never mind who I came with
Man, I never ever want to leave, let me stay lit, let me stay

[Break: Cheshire]
I know you're quite the dreamer
Be careful, this could end up being your reality

[Refrain]
What a wizard I am, bitch, I'm the man
Don't be scared give me your hand, take you to Wonderland
Man, this really ain't in the plan, but fuck all your plans
Let's go

[Hook]
Wonderland is amazing, ain't it?
Never ever want to leave, let me stay lit
I've been partying for days on the same shit
Never mind, never mind who I came with

[Verse 2]
Picture perfect, ain't picture perfect
Colours of the images are inverted all for a purpose
I say this shit loud and clear for you all, I know you heard it
I know you learning ways of this place
And you show your concerns
And I understand how you feel, but fuck how you feel
You can only eat if you hunt and are you willing to kill?
Mercy is never shown and damn it, it's all I've known
Remember to pay your debts, this shit is some Game of Thrones
All I wanna know is right now is you with me?
Come fuck with me here, there's no life for you in the city
I can show you magic, I swear this shit is so trippy
Only you can have it, let's make a deal quick, on some real shit
All it takes is for you to hear and to feel this

[Refrain]
What a wizard I am, bitch, I'm the man
Don't be scared give me your hand, take you to Wonderland
Man, this really ain't in the plan, but fuck all your plans
Let's go

[Hook]
Wonderland is amazing, ain't it?
Never ever want to leave, let me stay lit
I've been partying for days on the same shit
Never mind, never mind who I came with (Eat, hunt, kill)
Wonderland is amazing, ain't it?
Never ever want to leave, let me stay lit
I've been partying for days on the same shit
Never mind, never mind who I came with
