[Intro]
A tale of gain and loss
Trials and persons will be explained
Don't be intimidated but it's OK to be confused
All will make sense in the end
They took her wings and told her flying was impossible
They told her women cannot call themselves kings
They told her fame is not made for everyone
Trials and persons will be explained
Women can be kings

[Break]
Yo, what they fucking mean she's nuh a king?
All these backwards bitches need to realise it's 2015
We redefining the very definition
All these pussies walking around scared, they're scared I'm a pioneer
They're scared I'm a revolutionary, they're scared of authenticity
I don't even know when they're gonna stop fucking about and embrace their rightful leader
Woman or not, Simz a bloodclaat king!

[Hook]
Oh, everybody should know that I'm king now
Yeah, still the person, that's for certain
I deserve it, shit is wavy, watch me surfing
You should know I'm not an earthling, alien in me from birth
Oh, how you feeling? How the fuck you feeling?
This is hurtful, won't apologise but demoralise
What you think is yours but is mine, everything is mine for the taking
You don't have to like it, you don't have to play it, still amazing
Still creating, learning pages, learning to stop learning faces
I'll forget you eventually, when you mention them
Don't fuck around and don't mention me
I'm still the person, the person, the person

[Bridge]
They told her "stop while you're ahead, Simbi
The industry will break you, Simbi, you're not strong enough
Find yourself fly, Simbi, you've been waiting long enough
You'll have to do more than rapping, Simbi
What else can you show me?"
(Everybody knows that I'm king now)
Do you hear that? Women can be kings

[Hook]
Oh, everybody should know that I'm king now
Yeah, still the person, that's for certain
I deserve it, shit is wavy, watch me surfing
You should know I'm not an earthling, alien in me from birth
Oh, how you feeling? How the fuck you feeling?
This is hurtful, won't apologise but demoralise
What you think is yours but is mine, everything is mine for the taking
You don't have to like it, you don't have to play it, still amazing
Still creating, learning pages, learning to stop learning faces
I'll forget you eventually, when you mention them
Don't fuck around and don't mention me
I'm still the person, the person, the person
