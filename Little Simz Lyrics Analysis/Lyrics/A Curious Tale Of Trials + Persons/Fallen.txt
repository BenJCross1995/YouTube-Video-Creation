All good things gotta come to an end sometimes
Gotta come to an end sometimes
All good things gotta come to an end sometimes
All good things come to an end sometimes, an end sometimes
You want me to see what it is you see
But I just can't believe what you believe in
An end sometimes, all good things come to
An end sometimes, an end sometimes
Oh
What do you mean, it ain't the end?
We've just gotta know when to let it go
Let it breathe, doesn't mean I will love you to the death
You and I both know that it's run its course
You and I both know that it's by force
We are new to this, but there is truth in this
We let it breathe, let it blossom, let it bloom to this
But good things don't last together
All good things come to an end in life
But souls live on forever
What's important to you
Ain't important to me
Yeah, this story's for you
I give you all of me
What's important to you
Ain't important to me
Yeah, this story's for you
