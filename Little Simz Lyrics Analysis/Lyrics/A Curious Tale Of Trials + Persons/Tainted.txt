[Intro]
She thinks
She thinks the world revolves around her, what she thinks
She blinks and sees nothing but flowers and leaves
Everything's rosy in her eyes
Closed-minded and blinded by the lights, makeup is her disguise
An insight of her life is nothing short of a lie
Money and time is nonexistent but to her, it's all that matters

[Hook 1]
Always knew I'd be in this position where I'm killing it
Yeah, I'm bragging and I tell 'em how the fuck I'm feeling
Money, money, money, money, yeah, you get the gist
You're talking 'bout loyalty but you don't know the meaning
I dare these niggas here to try me, you think you're the shit
But I've been like this from early from when I was teething
How I'm feeling, play my shit at parties, not museums
You can keep your love, it's just money that I'm reaching for

[Verse 1]
You can keep your love, it's the money I've been reaching for
Steady bossing, you should know what I've got in store
Everything is backwards, can I grow to be immature?
Shit, though, I've been leaning, you should know what this light is for
Killing my pride, you are
Here's the keys to my house and my car, not my heart
But my soul, shit is cold and it's dark, ooh
I love the paper, nothing will tear us apart, ooh
I love the hate, I know you're burning, I'm a star
Couple animals that ride with me, Noah's ark
Fuck the world, I'm rich, remind me who you are?
I don't do this for the music, fuck your keys and guitars
Just got here and I'm running this shit
I could buy your life if I wanted to, bitch
Invested in a business, my work has made that money flip
Play this in the club, play this to your kids
Play this when you're faded, have a smoke, have a sip
Have a dab, get loose, let me tell you what it is, uh
See, I don't owe the world shit, you div
I worked to get here, I'mma tell you how I live
Yeah, this is my lifestyle, either love it or hate it
Old friends look at me, they ain't happy I made it
Mum looks at me like where's the daughter I was raising?
She was gone long time, she was way too gracious

[Hook 2]
Always knew I'd be in this position where I'm killing it
Yeah, I'm bragging and I tell 'em how the fuck I'm feeling
Money, money, money, money, yeah, you get the gist
You're talking 'bout loyalty but you don't know the meaning
I dare these niggas here to try me, you think you're the shit
But I've been like this from early from when I was teething
How I'm feeling, play my shit at parties every day
You can keep your love, it's just money that made me this way

[Bridge]
Her whole world crashes and burns, turns to ashes, no looking back now
Having to deal with the fatal impact, how will she react now?
Calls upon things she left in the past due to her rotten attitude, longing for love again
Only reminiscing, this must be a lesson learnt or two
She looks above and around to ask for forgiveness
From me, from you
S-s-sorry, sorry
Ask God for forgiveness right now
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
Ask family for forgiveness right now
S-s-s-s-s-s-s-sorry, I'm sorry
Ask the world for forgiveness right now
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, s-s-sorry
Ask my people for forgiveness right now
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
Ask God for forgiveness right now
I'm sorry, s-s-s-sorry

[Hook 3]
Never thought I'd be in this position, this is such a myth
I lost all my money, how the fuck I'm feeling
I wish that I'd done this different when I had the chance
When I tell you that I'm sorry, I promise I mean it
God, I know we ain't spoke in a little bit
I know I'm not an angel but I'm not a demon
I know I'm not an angel but I'm not a demon
But you can keep your money, it's just love that I'm needing

[Outro]
Whoa. Fuck all of that! Give me the money, the cars, the crib, the keys, the everything, I mean the key to your life, the key to your soul, [?] get fucked. Fuck everyone else. This is me doing what I want, this is what I want, God, this is what I earned. If you're with me, you're with me, if you're not then do one. This is me, I'm a king, yeah
My soul is tainted, my soul is tainted, my soul is tainted
My soul is tainted, my soul is tainted, my soul is tainted
My soul is tainted, my soul is tainted, my soul is tainted
My soul is tainted, my soul is tainted, my soul is tainted
