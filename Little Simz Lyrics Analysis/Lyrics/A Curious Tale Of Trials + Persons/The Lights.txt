[Bridge]
You've been on the run, I've been on a run
What we running from? Look how far we've come
Look what you've become
I don't know you much

[Verse 1]
This is what the lights will do to you
How'd you find yourself without losing you?
Still the same person, why they look at you different?
Ain't your fault they're choosing to
And it's proof and these shits are blinding
They lie to me when telling me they're excited
I never really understood the concept of fame
Is it you or the people around you that change?
Is it true that after, nothing's the same?
Well to finding this out, man I'm on my way
I'm on one today, I must say
It's best to talk about what I face

[Hook 1]
How do these lights make you feel?
How do these lights make you feel?
How do these lights make you feel?
How do these lights make you feel? How do these

[Verse 2]
People judge without knowing you
Couldn't understand what you're going through
He ignored all the scrutiny
But on the edge of destruction, he was soon to be
Did you lose the key? Are you entirely
Tired of being here? You feel like you're causing a scene? Well
All he was looking for is love
I guess he found it in drugs
Guess he found it in clubs
Till he got caught up in some trouble then found it in cuffs
Is it the end for him? Who knows
But until then, shit

[Hook 2]
Now all these lights make him feel
Now all these lights make him feel
Now all these lights make him feel
Now all these lights make him feel, now all these

[Break]
Oh, we got caught up in the badness
How were we gonna hack this? But talk to me like

[Bridge]
You've been on the run, I've been on a run
What we running from? Look how far we've come
Look what you've become
I don't know you much
I've seen you 'bout these flashy events many times, still
I don't know you much
Know that you're very similar to me, you're the same, still
I don't know you much

[Verse 3]
Oh, what these lights have done to her
This lifestyle's never been fun to her
Trials of the past can't run from her
She's incomplete and her stomach churns
And no one's concerned, nothing's learned
Nothing's worth it all, nothing's learned
Pills are popped when the head is hurting
But more than three if that doesn't work
Now suicide's what them papers say
Nobody's at her grave today
Another young soul just fades away
While another young soul is on its way
Shit, what these lights will do in life
But darkness has never been a friend of mine
It's lonely at the top, I've got a fear of heights
Said it's lonely at the top, I've got a fear of heights
Said it's lonely at the top, come share my light

[Hook 1]
How do these lights make you feel?
How do these lights make you feel?
How do these lights make you feel?
How do these lights make you feel? How do these
