[Verse 1: Little Simz]
Oh, broken homes and lonely souls is all they know
All they've shown is courage despite the circumstances
Time is passing by, stars command the sky
Don't play dumb by asking why
You already know how all the stories involve
Came here on my own, former that we leaving alone
Put my feet in the studio and call it my home
While others have got no way out
How blessed am I? Nothing left to find
Your life's on the line, don't question mine
Take my advice, don't stress in life
Arms out to you, you can rest your head in mine
I'm prepared to fly with no landing
I might just be the last one standing
They should know that Simz ain't ramping
I came to show there's more, I'm expanding
Still on my lonesome
Give a fuck, I'm chosen
Bit of luck and a wish, maybe we'll get there
But for now, I'm zoning
Somewhere in the air, I'm floating
They will not control us
This the type of shit that ain't never gonna sell
Man, you shouldn't have told us that
Nah, you shouldn't have

[Hook: The Hics]
I'm crawling up these walls
But they won't come down, no, they won't come down
I'm tearing at the core
Till their words drown out, till their words drown
Clawing at the heart, the trust
You take the little pieces, covering up my soul
I'm just a fool in your game
My life, your prey

[Verse 2: Little Simz]
I ain't never had a chance to do what I love
Ain't nobody ever been encouraging me
I just stay indoors, wishing and dreaming
Maybe in another life, it will happen for me
I put all my energy into feeding my kids
Do they appreciate the sacrifice I made for 'em?
No, their daddy ain't around and I have to make up excuses
As to why he hasn't yet came for 'em, oh lord
Why did you pick me, lord?
What is it that you can see in me, lord?
I'mma write this down, something to report
No air in me, I'm learning to breathe more
How I feel insane, the effect is a glass ceiling
Do it cause I love it and not cause I'm tryna make a killing
Hell no, saying what I like, you can tell so
And if there's a problem, hit me on my cell phone
Know a couple brothers talking through a jail phone
On their best behaviour but still walk it hibernal, shit's fucked
No, I don't owe you nuttin'
Talk that talk if you're gonna do something
If I was in this position like a year ago
I probably would've fell off like a year ago
Fill my pockets, yeah, it's money that we run alone
But fuck that, tell my people that I'm coming home
I'm coming home, boy

[Hook: The Hics]
I'm crawling up these walls
But they won't come down, no, they won't come down
I'm tearing at the core
Till their words drown out, till their words drown
Clawing at the heart, the trust
You take the little pieces, covering up my soul
I'm just a fool in your game
My life, your prey
