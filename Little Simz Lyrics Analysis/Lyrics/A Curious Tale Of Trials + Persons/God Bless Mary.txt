[Verse 1]
All I could think about in my maths class was
Rhyming and figuring out my timing
Couldn't get me to shut up if you didn't hear me, I'm miming
Teachers didn't understand the unique world that I'm in
While you was finding the answers, it's instrumentals I'm finding
I know, I should've paid attention more
Still got to where I am, I wouldn't change my life for yours
Soon as I got my first paycheck man I wanted some more
And then I got my second fuck it, it's music galore
I invested in equipment, fuck it, I'm takin' it all
Do this shit myself, but now there's Mary next door
I know for a fact this just might be a problem
Cause when I turn those speakers up there ain't no one to stop me
So in love with the sound, it probably messed with my hearing
When I recorded this like I needed Mary to hear it
Come to think of it, she's heard everything before the world has
Heard the EPs way before the world has
Heard me singing live way before the world has
Heard my mistakes and frustration way before the world has
I know I should turn it down, couldn't resist
Saw her smoking fags out the window, I knew she was pissed
Shit, I didn't consider that she prolly couldn't sleep
I know that it's selfish, at the time I couldn't see
Nothing's really changed though, man, I've been real
But I never said sorry and this is my apology
God bless Mary (sorry)

[Hook]
I know it don't do shit for you if I go global
But through these walls, I know you hear my vocal
And I know you don't need nothing from me
No you don't need nothing from me
No you don't need nothing from me, from me

[Verse 2]
You could've called the council on me so many times
Could've called the police so many times
Know you was pissed, man, I saw so many signs
Wanted to speak to you but thought 'never mind'
You smiling at me like it's alright
But I should've known that it's not alright
I'ma turn it down to consider your night
But let me turn it up for me one more time
One more time, please can you bear with me
I'm just tryna make music to change my life
No, you don't owe me anything cos I
Know you put up with everything onsite
Prolly hear this playing from your bedroom on repeat
Wrote a song about my neighbour as you will conceive
Though nothing's really changed, though man I'll be real
But I never said sorry and this is my apology
So god bless Mary!

[Hook]
I know it don't do shit for you if I go global
But through these walls, I know you hear my vocal
And I know you don't need nothing from me
No you don't need nothing from me
No you don't need nothing from me, from me

[Verse 3]
Yo, now this shit started from my bedroom many moons ago
God how am I gonna make this work? I bet you will know
Need your love and guidance to take me to where I wanna go
Wish upon a star, same star that followed me home
Learning to be more patient than ever, know my time will come
Will have more time on my hands when the record's done
Put in so much work, I hardly got to see my mum
Hardly got to see my nephew and live and be 21
Still I know I'll make it, some day
Know that I'm not perfect but I swear that it'll be worth it
Mary know that I'ma make it, one day
You just gotta trust me but know I'm not in a hurry
Promise I will make it big, some day
I'll make it big, some day
I don't know your full story or what you've been through
I just wanna say thank you and god bless you
God bless Mary

[Hook]
I know it don't do shit for you if I go global
But through these walls, I know you hear my vocal
And I know you don't need nothing from me
No you don't need nothing from me
No you don't need nothing from me, from me
