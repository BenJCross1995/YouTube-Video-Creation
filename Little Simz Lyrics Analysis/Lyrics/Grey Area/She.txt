[Chorus]
We shoulda never raised the bar (the bar, the bar, the bar, the bar)
They didn't want it from the start (the start, the start, the start, the start)

[Verse 1]
Ooh, it's the black sheep
Niggas know I really came up from the backseat
Now we take trips around the world in a flash, true
Go to Shibuya just to ink my skin in Japanese
Make sure that you look into my eyes when you see me
And understand I'm Lauryn in her prime when you see me
I've got Osiris with me, know he rule the underworld
Real goddess roll up in this bitch lookin' there for Titi

[Chorus]
We shoulda never raised the bar (the bar, the bar, the bar, the bar)
They didn't want it from the start (the start, the start, the start, the start)

[Post-Chorus]
I know that you strugglin' the world, oh
I know that you can't get over your past self
I know you feel no-one can see you
I know that pain's holdin' you back
And I know you still fighting with yourself, oh
And I know you heard bullets in your church, oh
And I know you know silence doesn't work, oh
And you know that you controllin' you

[Verse 2]
A true phase, going through a real maze
No moves, I was in the same place
Get your facts, runnin' in and outta flats
Thirteen tryna get to a stack, ten years late, shit (shit)
On my paper shit, skrt skrt
Run the fuck shit, then I changed the gear
That's the hood imbedded in me to the core
Of course, stay drippin' in sauce
Sometimes I wonder (sometimes I wonder)

[Chorus]
We shoulda never raised the bar (the bar, the bar, the bar, the bar, ay)
They didn't want it from the start (the start, the start, the start, the start)
We shoulda never raised the bar (the bar, the bar, the bar, the bar)
They didn't want it from the start (the start, the start, the start, the start)
