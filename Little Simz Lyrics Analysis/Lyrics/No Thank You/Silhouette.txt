[Verse 1: Little Simz]
Step into the shadow if you're tryna hide your silhouette
When they stab you in the back, trust me, they ain't finished yet
Had them on they toes, got 'em doin' pirouette
All this fake love got me feelin' I'm the realest here
You know what the deal is here
She can do this without me, yeah, that's they biggest fear
You didn't know niggas wanna take credit for somethin' they nevеr owned
Talkin' on my name like thе devil is in your tone
Don't you know I'm God's child? Got here on my own
Turn wine into water and get blood out of a stone
You give me an inch and want it back, man, I been through this
All problems deep-rooted
Lost love and they need Cupid
No time for your words, please don't smart talk if you been stupid
Oh, damn, she ruthless
Been proven, Beethoven, no keys, deep music
When the drums speak to me, I just breathe through it
Cool with a little flare, how does she do it?
I don't try too hard, there's an ease to it
The price goes up when you add me to it
Then up again when you add Dean to it
When the family tight, can't see through it
Look around if you tryna find out who you are
Now you got a missing piece, I was the biggest part

[Chorus: Cleo Sol]
You got to look inside yourself
Your insecurity won't break me down
You only see the silhouette, but don't hold your breath
I'm protected by the light, realise you can't crush my soul

[Verse 2: Little Simz]
Yeah, used to have a bond and now I see you as no friend of mine
Couldn't see it at the time, God was showin' many signs
Guard up with my eyes on very wide
Sittin' here reflectin' on myself and sippin' cherry wine
Like we should've been choppin'
You thought I didn't see the change, but I been clockin'
I'm very wise
Never knew how much I needed to set some boundaries
If you were a fan of me, how can you be mad at me?
Lettin' go isn't easy, I'll admit and it saddens me
If you knew how this has made me question my sanity
How could I ever doubt my truth and what I'm feelin'?
It's better revealin', we all need some healin'
Rackin' my brain tryna discover the meanin'
Who even knows?
I had to look deep within to find what I was seekin'
Layin' down, eyes closed, no sleepin'
No appetite, I was barely eatin'
Hundred miles per hour, my heart beatin'
While I know I got an army that I'm leadin'
Tryna figure it out, bobbin' and weavin'
Compassion I been needin', now it's unfoldin'
I ain't even finished yet
Light was shinin' on you, now I see you as a silhouette

[Bridge]
Find your way
Find your faith
God's with you always

[Verse 3: Little Simz]
If this is evolution, I'm in luck
'Cause I don't wanna be here and be stuck
Wish we could've transitioned together
I gave you all I had, gave you my trust
No one ever tells you when it's fucked
No one ever tells you it will probably leave you crushed
That's when you find the strength and pick yourself up
I know I'ma get through this, it's a must
Growin' is painful, it cannot be rushed
Used to seein' your name pop up, but I'll adjust
Everybody givin' their opinion
But really, I should listen to my gut
No more kindness for weakness
So pull up with that bullshit and I'll nip it in a bud
Better do the work if you ain't looked in the mirror yet
I don't wanna live my life bein' a silhouette

[Chorus: Cleo Sol]
Your insecurity won't break me down
You only see the silhouette, but don't hold your breath
I'm protected by the light, realise you can't crush my soul

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Outro]
Time will heal you
Time will heal you
Find your way
Find your faith
God's with you always
Time will heal you
Time will heal you
Find your way
Find your faith
God's with you always
