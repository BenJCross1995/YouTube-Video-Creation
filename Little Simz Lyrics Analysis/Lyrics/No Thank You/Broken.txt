[Intro]
Feel you're broken and you don't exist
When you feel you're broken and you cannot fix it
Feel you're broken and you don't exist
When you feel you're broken and you cannot fix it

[Verse 1]
What does it mean to be broken? The wound is painfully open
The beauty is in the findin' the darkest parts of the ocean
Deep waters in motion, the tide was comin' in heavy
I always knew I was chosen to handle whatever chose me
Pickin' all of my poisons, abandonin' my emotions
Questions got me feelin' like I shouldn't never have spoken
Damn right I'm spillin', the narrative, they keep switchin'
All I wanted to do was uplift the women
You gotta move if you ain't backin' the vision
They wanna see you a victim and givin' up on your mission
I been hittin' some lows and never tellin' a soul
You can have everything and nothing, still, nobody knows
There's a reason why the doves will never fly with the crows
Chapters eventually close, your friends will turn into foes
Everybody's so obsessed with the CEO
She probably got the most troubles that she'll never disclose
Dealin' with the dark by takin' the white to the nose
Poker face in action, continuin' with the show
Scrutinised for freein' the truth about the system
All she wanted to do was uplift the women

[Chorus]
Feel you're broken and you don't exist
When you feel you're broken and you cannot fix it
Feel you're broken and you don't exist
When you feel you're broken and you cannot fix it

[Verse 2]
What does it mean to be broken? Feels like your light has been stolen
Can't recognise you are golden
And you don't see that you're loved
Smokin' weed on your ones, isolatin' yourself
"Am I even enough?", then you question yourself
"Man, this week has been tough," been sayin' that for a year
How do I disappear? Can I hide from my fears?
Sometimes, a feather can feel like a stone
When your soul weak, you can feel that shit in your bones
She was lonely, takin' anyone to the home
Gettin' cozy, internal insecurities travellin' so deep
We all go through our hardships
But no life book, so knees to the carpet
And pray you're bein' guided by a force so you can't sink
Look how far you've come and see you've only just started
You exist, you alive, you are deservin' of life
You are a beacon of light, you are determined to fly
You have a journal inside, you have the power to write
You have the opportunity every day to decide, choose love
It might just blossom into a new love
But whatever happens, just know that you've won

[Chorus]
Feel you're broken and you don't exist
When you feel you're broken and you cannot fix it
Feel you're broken and you don't exist
When you feel you're broken and you cannot fix it

[Verse 3]
Ain't no happiness in it
Fake smiles just to deal with all the pain you've been given
As a child, they didn't tell you that your dreams can come into fruition
You never been to that place you envision
Sky gave you limits you had no choice but to accept
Forced into work to contribute to the profit of Britain
That sneeze'll be blessed, but the coughing'll kill 'em
It's the armageddon city, this shit might damage your soul
They won't take the weight off you when you can't manage the load
Like they're just waitin' to hear a fucking crack in your bones
Generational trauma you've had to deal with alone
No father, how do you become a man on your own?
Did the best that you could with the tools you were loaned
Didn't know how to break the mould and now you're raisin' a clone
Gives me comfort to believe you want the best for your seed
Wishful thinkin' if the intentions don't align with the deed
And if what you hear contradicts what you read, war ready
But travelled to this country for peace
Crabs in a barrel, your neighbour feelin' the same shit
But he might screw you if someone offers a payslip
No one ever told you your mind is not to be played with
No one ever taught you 'bout moderation and patience
Under all the eyes and the pressure and the scrutiny
Why is mental health a taboo in the Black community?

[Chorus]
Feel you're broken and you don't exist
When you feel you're broken and you cannot fix it
Feel you're broken and you don't exist
When you feel you're broken and you cannot fix it

[Verse 4]
It shouldn't be a norm to live your life as a tragedy
To live your life in a state of confusion and agony
Promises you made reflect the promises they gave you
And all these harsh experiences don't reflect your age
No family to save you, no friends to aid you
Can't even speak English, so there's no one to explain to
Only God to pray to
They denied you of your hope, but you found a way through
That's a breakthrough
Twenty-one, landed in London with hardly any funds
Twenty-seven, tryna get back to bein' twenty-one
'Cause nothing's changed, still no money, but more things to pay for
So the blood pressure rises slowly by the day
Work two jobs just so rice is on the children's plate
Landlord tells you, "This is the last time you can be late"
Health issues that you try to suppress
But all your health issues are derived from stress
You tried your best, gave an arm and a leg
Only tears and a cold house is what you've been left with
Self-hate for the Black skin you were blessed with
Hard to believe there's somethin' greater you were destined for
Preppin' for, gave your life to others, you didn't invest in yours
A broken soul, selected for God's plan
Everything will be what it's meant to when it's in God's hands

[Chorus]
Feel you're broken and you don't exist
When you feel you're broken and you cannot fix it
Feel you're broken and you don't exist
When you feel you're broken and you cannot fix it
Feel you're broken and you don't exist
When you feel you're broken and you cannot fix it
Feel you're broken and you don't exist
When you feel you're broken and you cannot fix it
