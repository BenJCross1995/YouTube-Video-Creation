[Intro: Kojo]
Your love is all I want and all I need
It's true
I've been alone so long
So, please don't let me go (Take control)
I've been alone so long
So, please don't let me go (Take control)

[Verse 1: Little Simz]
Under control, out of control
He is for me, for me to behold
You give me ocean and reason to moan
I'll give you passion and keys to my soul
Which pleases you most?
Lyin' to self is easy for most
The next morning, looked at me and smiled with a glare in his eye
There's a limit on the timе that we share in this life
Lеt go and let God handle it
Tell me what it is that you really fear in this life
Sometimes, when you have trauma, you think trauma's gonna show up at your door anytime
Call me anytime, lost in my head, more than a sign
Two bodies intertwine, an electric feel right now
'Cause the energies match
New territory when the connection builds and you have memories attached
Hard to let go
You wouldn't do me like that
Time heals, but the love never die for you
Had to let go of the pride for you
I'm mature, put it all on the line for you
Know you wanna hear my truth
I wanna hear yours, I'm listenin' too
Lookin' through a wabi-sabi lens so I get a wabi-sabi view
I don't wanna hear bad news
Look at how far we've come
At a time when we've got the most shit to lose

[Chorus: Kojo]
Promise to take my hand and never let it go
'Cause your love is all I have and all I know
Take control

[Verse 2: Little Simz]
I got nothin' to hide, give you a piece of my mind
When the waves are against me, I just go with the tide
Learnin' compassion and patience, tryna swallow my pride
Never wanna be complacent, it's either I ride or I die
I had the best night of my life
We was walkin' 'round the city, lookin' at architectural designs
Doin' shrooms in a hotel room, turnin' off all of the lights
Gimme all of you, all of it
Smokin' on somethin', now the airwaves gettin' clogged up and I think it's love
If I give you soul, man, it's a deeper trust
Mai Tais on the beach, feet kicked up, yeah
Don't listen to a word they say
I'm in your head, like, every day
Then our favourite song gets played
It could be way simpler than it seems
You is a G, I is a G
Let's make a baby that's gorgeous and green
Oh, what a dream

[Outro: Kojo]
Take my hand and never let it go
Promise me you'll be here when I'm low
Take my hand and never let it go
Promise me you'll be here when I'm low
Take my hand and never let it go
