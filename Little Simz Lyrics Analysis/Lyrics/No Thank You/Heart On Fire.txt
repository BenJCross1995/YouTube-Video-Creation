[Intro]
(My heart's on f–)

[Verse 1: Little Simz]
Look
Honesty between a seller and a buyer should be a given
But, man, I didn't know you were a liar
Dropped out of college, still, I made it through the wire
We was tryna hustle whatever was ten just for a fiver
"Don't sell yourself short, miss," said the driver
Was on my way to gettin' caught in the crossfire
I mean, lavish livin', drippin' designer
"Who you wearin'?", they so enchanted by attire (My heart's on f–)
Heart's on fire, bought the dream with еvery penny that I acquired
It's a sеt-up and you'll be next up to those prior
Devil works hard, but the business works harder
I vowed from now to work smarter
They won't do it like us, for the people, by us
Why they wanna fight us? Spirit on higher
God made truth of everything I desire (My heart's on f–)
I don't need much as long as I got my baby, he a rider
He sittin' beside her, that's who she confide in
They want you connivin', creepin' with your side ting
Makin' up a story that equals somebody buyin'
New world order 'cause life as we know is dyin'
Not thrivin', it's only a matter of timin', ain't it just
Funny how you can literally give your everything?
Somebody gonna turn around and tell you you ain't gave enough (My heart's on f–)
Danger, what you afraid of?
Acknowledgin' it's impossible now to restrain her
Worst thing I could've done is put trust in a stranger
But that needed to happen for me only to wake up
The suits'll get in your ear when your shit poppin'
Lies overflowin' and they ain't stoppin'
You don't even recognise who it is that you're becomin'
They don't give a shit long as the gravy train runnin' (My heart's on f–)

[Chorus]
My life is a blessing
But it comes with the stresses
And I can't take it all
Just don't let me down when I'm in the fire
(My heart's on f–)

[Verse 2: Little Simz]
We all start off so pure
Do it for the love, nothin' more
Nah, maybe to cop mum a house, but nothin' more
Maybe to sort my cousin out, but nothin' more
Maybe I'll get the new coupe and nothin' more
Fifteen to a hundred shoes, nothin' more
By the time you know it, that list never stop growin'
And you don't know what you even do this for (My heart's on f–)
Hearts on fire, hearts on grandeur
Ballroom gowns as champagne pours
Is the afterparty a social party?
With everybody talkin', the music should've been paused
Marble floors and tall glass doors is what you're in for
Did you read the clause?
It was never about lookin' for results
Now every time you do something, you need an applause (My heart's on f–)
Please keep your head on when you're goin' through the maze
'Cause navigatin' the fame is something you're never trained for
Tell me what you came for
Wanted better days and now you're runnin' away from that very thing you prayed for
Tell me, am I trippin' or is the light blindin'?
Am I anxious or am I excited?
Am I calm or am I unbothered?
Or maybe I needed my fire to be ignited? (My heart's on f–)
Heart's on

[Chorus]
My life is a blessing
But it comes with the stresses
And I can't take it all
Just don't let me down when I'm in the fire
(My heart's on f–)
My life is a blessing
But it comes with the stresses
And I can't take it all
Just don't let me down when I'm in the fire
(My heart's on f–)
