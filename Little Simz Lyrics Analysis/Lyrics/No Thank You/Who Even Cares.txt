[Intro: Cleo Sol]
Who even cares if they say anything?
We're not scared
Who even cares if they say anything?
We're not scared
Who even cares if they say anything?
We're not scared
Who even cares if they say anything?
We're not scared

[Verse 1: Little Simz]
Workin' double shifts, undercover
Life's only gettin' tougher, but your faith help you see it through
Had to kill the ego and put all the pride to the side
'Cause thе rent been overdue
Whеn you stopped goin' to college, they told you you need the knowledge
But the work didn't better you
So you live your life modest in reality's promise that your dreams ain't comin' true
You was in a daze all summer, tryna kill the habit of wantin' the rain to fall down on you
Every day is a hustle through the pain and the struggle
Don't break, it'll be okay
Tryna figure out where the missin' piece to the puzzle fits
And why God has chosen you
Tryna figure out where the missin' piece to the puzzle fits
And why God has chosen you

[Chorus: Cleo Sol]
Who even cares if they say anything?
We're not scared
We're not scared
Who even cares if they say anything? (Who even cares if they say anything?)
We're not scared
We're not scared (I'm not scared, no, I'm not scared, no, no)
Who even cares if they say anything? (Who even cares if they say anything?)
We're not scared
We're not scared (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Little Simz]
In this rat race, we all gotta get it somehow
Can't worry about the others now
So you live your life honest because all you've ever wanted was only to make your mother proud
In this rat race, we all gotta get it somehow
Can't worry about the others now
They will smile up in your face and ask you about the days
You told 'em you'd make a hundred thou'
White tee and your old ripped jeans on
Ain't no Fashion Week, Louis Vuitton
Livin' in the shade all summer, just as life got realer
No time to be runnin' 'round
Feelin' like you're back at square one with baggage that weigh a tonne
Nobody to lean on now
Tryna figure out where the missin' piece to the puzzle fits
And why God has chosen you

[Chorus: Cleo Sol]
Who even cares if they say anything?
We're not scared
Who even cares if they say anything? (Who even cares if they say anything?)
We're not scared
We're not scared (I'm not scared, no, I'm not scared, no, no)
Who even cares if they say anything? (Who even cares if they say anything?)
We're not scared
We're not scared (I'm not scared)
Who even cares if they say anything? (Who even cares if they say anything?)
We're not scared
We're not scared (I'm not scared)

[Outro: Cleo Sol]
(Promise not to give it away)
(Promise not to give it away)
(Promise not to give it away)
(Promise not to give it away)
Who even cares if they say anything?
We're not scared (Promise not to give it away)
(Promise not to give it away)
Who even cares if they say anything?
We're not scared (Promise not to give it away)
We're not scared (I'm not scared, no, I'm not scared, no, no)
(Promise not to give it away)
